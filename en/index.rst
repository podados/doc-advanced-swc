Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry in Python

Welcome!  You have stumbled upon the class handouts for a course I
taught at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, June 12-June 14, 2007.

These notes are intended to *accompany* my lecture, which was a
demonstration of a variety of "intermediate" Python features and
packages.  Because the demonstration was interactive, these notes are
not complete notes of what went on in the course.  (Sorry about that;
they *have* been updated from my actual handouts to be more
complete...)

However, all 70 pages are free to view and print, so enjoy.

All errors are, of course, my own.  Note that almost all of the
examples starting with '>>>' are doctests, so you can take `the source
<combined.txt>`__ and run doctest on it to make sure I'm being honest.
But do me a favor and run the doctests with Python 2.5 ;).

Note that Day 1 of the course ran through the end of "Testing Your
Software"; Day 2 ran through the end of "Online Resources for Python";
and Day 3 finished it off.

Example code (mostly from the C extension sections) is available `here
<http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/code.tar.gz>`__; see the
`README <http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/code/README.txt>`__
for more information.
