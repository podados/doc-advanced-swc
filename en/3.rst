Testing Your Software
=====================

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it."  -- Brian W. Kernighan.

Everyone tests their software to some extent, if only by running it
and trying it out (technically known as "smoke testing").  Most
programmers do a certain amount of exploratory testing, which involves
running through various functional paths in your code and seeing if
they work.

Systematic testing, however, is a different matter.  Systematic
testing simply cannot be done properly without a certain (large!)
amount of automation, because every change to the software means that
the software needs to be tested all over again. 

Below, I will introduce you to some lower level automated testing
concepts, and show you how to use built-in Python constructs to start
writing tests.

An introduction to testing concepts
-----------------------------------

There are several types of tests that are particularly useful to
research programmers.  *Unit tests* are tests for fairly small and
specific units of functionality.  *Functional tests* test entire
functional paths through your code.  *Regression tests* make sure
that (within the resolution of your records) your program's output
has not changed.

All three types of tests are necessary in different ways.

Regression tests tell you when unexpected changes in behavior occur,
and can reassure you that your basic data processing is still working.
For scientists, this is particularly important if you are trying to
link past research results to new research results: if you can no
longer replicate your original results with your updated code, then
you must regard your code with suspicion, *unless* the changes are
intentional.

By contrast, both unit and functional tests tend to be *expectation*
based.  By this I mean that you use the tests to lay out what behavior
you *expect* from your code, and write your tests so that they *assert*
that those expectations are met.

The difference between unit and functional tests is blurry in most
actual implementations; unit tests tend to be much shorter and require
less setup and teardown, while functional tests can be quite long. I
like Kumar McMillan's distinction: functional tests tell you *when*
your code is broken, while unit tests tell you *where* your code is
broken.  That is, because of the finer granularity of unit tests, a
broken unit test can identify a particular piece of code as the source
of an error, while functional tests merely tell you that a feature is
broken.

The doctest module
------------------

Let's start by looking at the doctest module.  If you've been
following along, you will be familiar with doctests, because I've been
using them throughout this text!  A doctest links code and behavior
explicitly in a nice documentation format.  Here's an example:

>>> print 'hello, world'
hello, world

When doctest sees this in a docstring or in a file, it knows that it
should execute the code after the '>>>' and compare the actual output
of the code to the strings immediately following the '>>>' line.

To execute doctests, you can use the doctest API that comes with
Python: just type: ::

   import doctest
   doctest.testfile(textfile)

or ::

   import doctest
   doctest.testmod(modulefile)

The doctest docs contain complete documentation for the module, but
in general there are only a few things you need to know.

First, for multi-line entries, use '...' instead of '>>>':

>>> def func():
...   print 'hello, world'
>>> func()
hello, world

Second, if you need to elide exception code, use '...':

>>> raise Exception("some error occurred")
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
Exception: some error occurred

More generally, you can use '...' to match random output, as long as you
you specify a doctest directive:

>>> import random
>>> print 'random number:', random.randint(0, 10)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
random number: ...

Third, doctests are terminated with a blank line, so if you
explicitly expect a blank line, you need to use a special construct:

>>> print ''
<BLANKLINE>

To test out some doctests of your own, try modifying these files
and running them with ``doctest.testfile``.

Doctests are useful in a number of ways.  They encourage a kind of
conversation with the user, in which you (the author) demonstrate how
to actually use the code.  And, because they're executable, they
ensure that your code works as you expect.  However, they can also
result in quite long docstrings, so I recommend putting long doctests
in files separate from the code files.  Short doctests can go anywhere
-- in module, class, or function docstrings.

Unit tests with unittest
------------------------

If you've heard of automated testing, you've almost certainly heard of
unit tests.  The idea behind unit tests is that you can constrain the
behavior of small units of code to be correct by testing the bejeezus
out of them; and, if your smallest code units are broken, then how can
code built on top of them be good?

The `unittest module <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html>`__
comes with Python.  It provides a framework for writing and running
unit tests that is at least convenient, if not as simple as it could be
(see the 'nose' stuff, below, for something that is simpler).

Unit tests are almost always demonstrated with some sort of numerical
process, and I will be no different.  Here's a simple unit test, using
the unittest module: ::

 test_sort.py:

  #! /usr/bin/env python
  import unittest
  class Test(unittest.TestCase):
   def test_me(self):
      seq = [ 5, 4, 1, 3, 2 ]
      seq.sort()
      self.assertEqual(seq, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

  if __name__ == '__main__':
     unittest.main()

If you run this, you'll see the following output: ::

  .
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 1 test in 0.000s

  OK

Here, ``unittest.main()`` is running through all of the symbols in the
global module namespace and finding out which classes inherit from
``unittest.TestCase``.  Then, for each such class, it finds all methods
starting with ``test``, and for each one it instantiates a new object
and runs the function: so, in this case, just: ::

  Test().test_me()

If any method fails, then the failure output is recorded and presented
at the end, but the rest of the test methods are run irrespective.

``unittest`` also includes support for test *fixtures*, which are functions
run before and after each test; the idea is to use them to set up and
tear down the test environment.  In the code below, ``setUp`` creates
and shuffles the ``self.seq`` sequence, while ``tearDown`` deletes it. ::

 test_sort2.py:

    #! /usr/bin/env python
    import unittest
    import random

    class Test(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            self.seq = range(0, 10)
            random.shuffle(self.seq)

        def tearDown(self):
            del self.seq

        def test_basic_sort(self):
            self.seq.sort()
            self.assertEqual(self.seq, range(0, 10))

        def test_reverse(self):
            self.seq.sort()
            self.seq.reverse()
            self.assertEqual(self.seq, [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])

        def test_destruct(self):
            self.seq.sort()
            del self.seq[-1]
            self.assertEqual(self.seq, range(0, 9))

    unittest.main()

In both of these examples, it's important to realize that an *entirely
new object* is created, and the fixtures run, for each test function.  This
lets you write tests that alter or destroy test data without having to
worry about interactions between the code in different tests.

Testing with nose
-----------------

nose is a unit test discovery system that makes writing and organizing
unit tests very easy.  I've actually written a whole separate article on
them, so we should go `check that out <nose-intro.html>`__.

.. (CTB: testing primes?)

Code coverage analysis
----------------------

`figleaf <http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf/README.html>`__
is a code coverage recording and analysis system that I wrote and
maintain.  It's published in PyPI, so you can install it with
easy_install.

Basic use of figleaf is very easy.  If you have a script ``program.py``,
rather than typing ::

       % python program.py

to run the script, run ::

       % figleaf program.py

This will transparently and invisibly record coverage to the file
'.figleaf' in the current directory.  If you run the program several
times, the coverage will be aggregated.

To get a coverage report, run 'figleaf2html'.  This will produce a
subdirectory ``html/`` that you can view with any Web browser; the
index.html file will contain a summary of the code coverage, along
with links to individual annotated files.  In these annotated files,
executed lines are colored green, while lines of code that are not
executed are colored red.  Lines that are not considered lines of code
(e.g. docstrings, or comments) are colored black.

My main use for code coverage analysis is in testing (which is why I
discuss it in this section!)  I record the code coverage for my unit
and functional tests, and then examine the output to figure out which
files or libraries to focus on testing next.  As I discuss below, it
is relatively easy to achieve 70-80% code coverage by this method.

When is code coverage most useful?  I think it's most useful in the
early and middle stages of testing, when you need to track down code
that is not touched by your tests.  However, 100% code coverage by your
tests doesn't guarantee bug free code: this is because figleaf only measures
line coverage, not branch coverage.  For example, consider this code: ::

  if a.x or a.y:
     f()

If ``a.x`` is True in all your tests, then ``a.y`` will never be
evaluated -- even though ``a`` may not have an attribute ``y``, which
would cause an AttributeError (which would in turn be a bug, if not
properly caught).  Python does not record which subclauses of the
``if`` statement are executed, so without analyzing the structure of
the program there's no simple way to figure it out.

Here's another buggy example with 100% code coverage: ::

   def f(a):
      if a:
         a = a.upper()
      return a.strip()

   s = f("some string")

Here, there's an implicit ``else`` after the if statement; the function f()
could be rewritten to this: ::

   def f(a):
      if a:
         a = a.upper()
      else:
         pass
      return a.strip()

   s = f("some string")

and the pass statement would show up as "not executed".

So, bottom line: 100% test coverage is *necessary* for a well-tested
program, because code that is not executed by any test at all is
simply not being tested.  However, 100% test coverage is not
*sufficient* to guarantee that your program is free of bugs, as you can
see from some of the examples above.

Adding tests to an existing project
-----------------------------------

This testing discussion should help to convince you that not only
*should* you test, but that there are plenty of tools available to
*help* you test in Python.  It may even give you some ideas about how
to start testing new projects.  However, retrofitting an *existing*
project with tests is a different, challenging problem -- where do you
start?  People are often overwhelmed by the amount of code they've
written in the past.

I suggest the following approach.

First, start by writing a test for each bug as they are discovered.
The procedure is fairly simple: isolate the cause of the bug; write a
test that demonstrates the bug; fix the bug; verify that the test
passes.  This has several benefits in the short term: you are fixing
bugs, you're discovering weak points in your software, you're becoming
more familiar with the testing approach, and you can start to think
about commonalities in the fixtures necessary to *support* the tests.

Next, take out some time -- half a day or so -- and write fixtures and
functional tests for some small chunk of code; if you can, pick a piece
of code that you're planning to clean up or extend.  Don't worry about
being exhaustive, but just write tests that target the main point of
the code that you're working on.

Repeat this a few times.  You should start to discover the benefits of
testing at this point, as you increasingly prevent bugs from occurring
in the code that's covered by the tests.  You should also start to get
some idea of what fixtures are necessary for your code base.

Now use code coverage analysis to analyze what code your tests cover,
and what code isn't covered.  At this point you can take a targetted
approach and spend some time writing tests aimed directly at uncovered
areas of code.  There should now be tests that cover 30-50% of your
code, at least (it's very easy to attain this level of code
coverage!).

Once you've reached this point, you can either decide to focus on
increasing your code coverage, or (my recommendation) you can simply
continue incrementally constraining your code by writing tests for bugs
and new features.  Assuming you have a fairly normal code churn, you should
get to the point of 70-80% coverage within a few months to a few years
(depending on the size of the project!)

This approach is effective because at each stage you get immediate
feedback from your efforts, and it's easier to justify to managers
than a whole-team effort to add testing.  Plus, if you're unfamiliar
with testing or with parts of the code base, it gives you time to adjust
and adapt your approach to the needs of the particular project.

Two articles that discuss similar approaches in some detail are
available online: `Strangling Legacy Code
<http://www.stickyminds.com/s.asp?F=S9705_MAGAZINE_2>`__, and `Growing
Your Test Harness
<http://www.developertesting.com/archives/GrowYourHarness.pdf>`__.  I
can also recommend the book `Working Effectively with Legacy Code

Concluding thoughts on automated testing
----------------------------------------

Starting to do automated testing of your code can lead to immense
savings in maintenance and can also increase productivity
dramatically.  There are a number of reasons why automated testing can
help so much, including quick discovery of regressions, increased
design awareness due to more interaction with the code, and early
detection of simple bugs as well as unwanted epistatic interactions
between code modules.  The single biggest improvement for me has been
the ability to refactor code without worrying as much about breakage.
In my personal experience, automated testing is a 5-10x productivity
booster when working alone, and it can save multi-person teams from
potentially disastrous errors in communication.

Automated testing is not, of course, a silver bullet.  There are several
common worries.

One worry is that by increasing the total amount of code in a project,
you increase both the development time and the potential for bugs and
maintenance problems.  This is certainly possible, but test code is
very different from regular project code: it can be removed much more
easily (which can be done whenever the code being tested undergoes
revision), and it should be *much* simpler even if it is in fact
bulkier.

Another worry is that too much of a focus on testing will decrease the
drive for new functionality, because people will focus more on writing
tests than they will on the new code.  While this is partly a
managerial issues, it is worth pointing out that the process of
writing new code will be dramatically faster if you don't have to
worry about old code breaking in unexpected ways as you add
functionality.

A third worry is that by focusing on automation, you will miss bugs in
code that is difficult to automate.  There are two considerations
here.  First, it is possible to automate quite a bit of testing; the
decision not to automat a particular test is almost always made
because of financial or time considerations rather than technical
limitations.  And, second, automated testing is simply not a
replacement for certain types of manual testing -- in particular,
exploratory testing, in which the programmers or users interact with
the program, will always turn up new bugs, and is worth doing
independent of the automated tests.

How much to test, and what to test, are decisions that need to be made
on an individual project basis; there are no hard and fast rules.
However, I feel confident in saying that some automated testing will
always improve the quality of your code and result in maintenance
improvements.
