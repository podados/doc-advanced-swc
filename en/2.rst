Structuring, Testing, and Maintaining Python Programs
=====================================================

Python is really the first programming language in which I started
re-using code significantly.  In part, this is because it is rather
easy to compartmentalize functions and classes in Python.  Something
else that Python makes relatively easy is building testing into your
program structure.  Combined, reusability and testing can have a huge
effect on maintenance.

Programming for reusability
---------------------------

It's difficult to come up with any hard and fast rules for programming
for reusability, but my main rules of thumb are: don't plan too much,
and don't hesitate to refactor your code. [#refactor]_.

In any project, you will write code that
you want to re-use in a slightly different context.  It will often be
easiest to cut and paste this code rather than to copy the module it's
in -- but try to resist this temptation a bit, and see if you can make
the code work for both uses, and then use it in both places.

.. [#refactor] If you haven't read Martin Fowler's **Refactoring**, do
   so -- it describes how to incrementally make your code better.
   I'll discuss it some more in the context of testing, below.

Modules and scripts
-------------------

The organization of your code source files can help or hurt you with
code re-use.

Most people start their Python programming out by putting everything in
a script: ::

 calc-squares.py:
   #! /usr/bin/env python
   for i in range(0, 10):
      print i**2

This is great for experimenting, but you can't re-use this code at all!

(UNIX folk: note the use of ``#! /usr/bin/env python``, which tells UNIX
to execute this script using whatever ``python`` program is first in your
path.  This is more portable than putting ``#! /usr/local/bin/python`` or
``#! /usr/bin/python`` in your code, because not everyone puts python in
the same place.)

Back to reuse.  What about this? ::

 calc-squares.py:
   #! /usr/bin/env python
   def squares(start, stop):
      for i in range(start, stop):
         print i**2

   squares(0, 10)

I think that's a bit better for re-use -- you've made ``squares``
flexible and re-usable -- but there are two mechanistic problems.
First, it's named ``calc-squares.py``, which means it can't readily be
imported.  (Import filenames have to be valid Python names, of
course!)  And, second, were it importable, it would execute ``squares(0, 10)``
on import - hardly what you want!

To fix the first, just change the name: ::

  calc_squares.py:
    #! /usr/bin/env python
    def squares(start, stop):
      for i in range(start, stop):
          print i**2
    
    squares(0, 10)

Good, but now if you do ``import calc_squares``, the ``squares(0, 10)`` code
will still get run!  There are a couple of ways to deal with this.  The first
is to look at the module name: if it's ``calc_squares``, then the module is
being imported, while if it's ``__main__``, then the module is being run as
a script: ::

  calc_squares.py:
    #! /usr/bin/env python
    def squares(start, stop):
      for i in range(start, stop):
         print i**2

    if __name__ == '__main__':
      squares(0, 10)

Now, if you run ``calc_squares.py`` directly, it will run ``squares(0, 10)``;
if you import it, it will simply define the ``squares`` function and leave
it at that.  This is probably the most standard way of doing it.

I actually prefer a different technique, because of my fondness for testing.
(I also think this technique lends itself to reusability, though.)  I
would actually write two files: ::

  squares.py:
    def squares(start, stop):
      for i in range(start, stop):
         print i**2

    if __name__ == `__main__`:
      # ...run automated tests...

  calc-squares:
    #! /usr/bin/env python
    import squares
    squares.squares(0, 10)

A few notes -- first, this is eminently reusable code, because
``squares.py`` is completely separate from the context-specific call.
Second, you can look at the directory listing in an instant and see
that ``squares.py`` is probably a library, while ``calc-squares`` must
be a script, because the latter cannot be imported.  Third, you can add
automated tests to ``squares.py`` (as described below), and run them
simply by running ``python squares.py``.  Fourth, you can add script-specific
code such as command-line argument handling to the script, and keep it
separate from your data handling and algorithm code.

Packages
--------

A Python package is a directory full of Python modules containing a
special file, ``__init__.py``, that tells Python that the directory is
a package.  Packages are for collections of library code that are too
big to fit into single files, or that have some logical substructure
(e.g. a central library along with various utility functions that all
interact with the central library).

For an example, look at this directory tree: ::

   package/
     __init__.py	-- contains functions a(), b()
     other.py		-- contains function c()
     subdir/
	__init__.py	-- contains function d()

From this directory tree, you would be able to access the functions like
so: ::

   import package
   package.a()
   package.b()

   import package.other
   package.other.c()

   import package.subdir
   package.subdir.d()

Note that ``__init__.py`` is just another Python file; there's nothing
special about it except for the name, which tells Python that the
directory is a package directory.  ``__init__.py`` is the only code
executed on import, so if you want names and symbols from other
modules to be accessible at the package top level, you have to import
or create them in ``__init__.py``.

There are two ways to use packages: you can treat them as a convenient
code organization technique, and make most of the functions or classes
available at the top level; or you can use them as a library
hierarchy.  In the first case you would make all of the names above
available at the top level: ::

 package/__init__.py:
   from other import c
   from subdir import d
   ...

which would let you do this: ::

   import package
   package.a()
   package.b()
   package.c()
   package.d()

That is, the names of the functions would all be immediately available at
the top level of the package, but the implementations would be spread out
among the different files and directories.  I personally prefer this because
I don't have to remember as much ;).  The down side is that everything gets
imported all at once, which (especially for large bodies of code) may be
slow and memory intensive if you only need a few of the functions.

Alternatively, if you wanted to keep the library hierarchy, just leave out
the top-level imports.  The advantage here is that you only import the
names you need; however, you need to remember more.

Some people are fond of package trees, but I've found that hierarchies
of packages more than two deep are annoying to develop on: you spend a
lot of your time browsing around between directories, trying to figure
out *exactly* which function you need to use and what it's named.
(Your mileage may vary.)  I think this is one of the main reasons why
the Python stdlib looks so big, because most of the packages are
top-level.

One final note: you can restrict what objects are exported from a module
or package by listing the names in the ``__all__`` variable.  So, if
you had a module ``some_mod.py`` that contained this code: ::

  some_mod.py:
    __all__ = ['fn1']
    
    def fn1(...):
	...

    def fn2(...):
	...

then only 'some_mod.fn1()' would be available on import.  This is a
good way to cut down on "namespace pollution" -- the presence of
"private" objects and code in imported modules -- which in turn makes
introspection useful.

A short digression: naming and formatting
-----------------------------------------

You may have noticed that a lot of Python code looks pretty similar --
this is because there's an "official" style guide for Python, called
`PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.  It's worth a quick
skim, and an occasional deeper read for some sections.

Here are a few tips that will make your code look internally
consistent, if you don't already have a coding style of your own:

 - use four spaces (NOT a tab) for each indentation level;

 - use lowercase, _-separated names for module and function names, e.g.
       ``my_module``;

 - use CapsWord style to name classes, e.g. ``MySpecialClass``;

 - use '_'-prefixed names to indicate a "private" variable that should
       not be used outside this module, , e.g. ``_some_private_variable``;

Another short digression: docstrings
------------------------------------

Docstrings are strings of text attached to Python objects like
modules, classes, and methods/functions.  They can be used to provide
human-readable help when building a library of code.  "Good" docstring
coding is used to provide additional information about functionality
beyond what can be discovered automatically by introspection; compare ::

  def is_prime(x):
      """
      is_prime(x) -> true/false.  Determines whether or not x is prime,
      and return true or false.
      """

versus ::

  def is_prime(x):
      """
      Returns true if x is prime, false otherwise.

      is_prime() uses the Bernoulli-Schmidt formalism for figuring out
      if x is prime.  Because the BS form is stochastic and hysteretic,
      multiple calls to this function will be increasingly accurate.
      """

The top example is good (documentation is good!), but the bottom
example is better, for a few reasons.  First, it is not redundant:
the arguments to ``is_prime`` are discoverable by introspection and
don't need to be specified.  Second, it's summarizable: the first line
stands on its own, and people who are interested in more detail can read
on.  This enables certain document extraction tools to do a better job.

For more on docstrings, see `PEP 257
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`__.

Sharing data between code
-------------------------

There are three levels at which data can be shared between Python
code: module globals, class attributes, and object attributes.  You
can also sneak data into functions by dynamically defining a function
within another scope, and/or binding them to keyword arguments.

Scoping: a digression
---------------------

Just to make sure we're clear on scoping, here are a few simple
examples.  In this first example, f() gets x from the module
namespace.

>>> x = 1
>>> def f():
...   print x
>>> f()
1

In this second example, f() overrides x, but only within the namespace
in f().

>>> x = 1
>>> def f():
...   x = 2 
...   print x
>>> f()
2
>>> print x
1

In this third example, g() overrides x, and h() obtains x from within g(),
because h() was *defined* within g():

>>> x = 1

>>> def outer():
...    x = 2
...
...    def inner():
...       print x
...
...    return inner

>>> inner = outer()
>>> inner()
2

In all cases, without a ``global`` declaration, assignments will
simply create a new local variable of that name, and not modify the
value in any other scope:

>>> x = 1
>>> def outer():
...    x = 2
...
...    def inner():
...       x = 3
...
...    inner()
...
...    print x
>>> outer()
2

However, *with* a ``global`` definition, the outermost scope is used:

>>> x = 1
>>> def outer():
...    x = 2
...
...    def inner():
...	  global x
...       x = 3
...
...    inner()
...
...    print x
>>> outer()
2
>>> print x
3

I generally suggest avoiding scope trickery as much as possible, in
the interests of readability.  There are two common patterns that I
use when I *have* to deal with scope issues.

First, module globals are sometimes necessary.  For one such case,
imagine that you have a centralized resource that you must initialize
precisely once, and you have a number of functions that depend on that
resource.  Then you can use a module global to keep track of the
initialization state.  Here's a (contrived!) example for a random
number generator that initializes the random number seed precisely
once: ::

  _initialized = False
  def init():
    global _initialized
    if not _initialized:
        import time
	random.seed(time.time())
	_initialized = True

  def randint(start, stop):
    init()
    ...

This code ensures that the random number seed is initialized only once by
making use of the ``_initialized`` module global.  A few points, however:

 - this code is not threadsafe.  If it was really important that the
   resource be initialized precisely once, you'd need to use thread locking.
   Otherwise two functions could call ``randint()`` at the same time and
   both could get past the ``if`` statement.

 - the module global code is very isolated and its use is very clear.
   Generally I recommend having only one or two functions that access the
   module global, so that if I need to change its use I don't have to
   understand a lot of code.

The other "scope trickery" that I sometimes engage in is passing data into
dynamically generated functions.  Consider a situation where you have to
use a callback API: that is, someone has given you a library function that
will call your own code in certain situations. For our example, let's look at
the ``re.sub`` function that comes with Python, which takes a callback
function to apply to each match.

Here's a callback function that uppercases words:

>>> def replace(m):
...   match = m.group()
...   print 'replace is processing:', match
...   return match.upper()
>>> s = "some string"

>>> import re
>>> print re.sub('\\S+', replace, s)
replace is processing: some
replace is processing: string
SOME STRING

What's happening here is that the ``replace`` function is called each
time the regular expression '\\S+' (a set of non-whitespace characters)
is matched.  The matching substring is replaced by whatever the
function returns.

Now let's imagine a situation where we want to pass information into
``replace``; for example, we want to process only words that match
in a dictionary.  (I *told* you it was contrived!)  We could simply rely
on scoping:

>>> d = { 'some' : True, 'string' : False }
>>> def replace(m):
...   match = m.group()
...   if match in d and d[match]:
...      return match.upper()
...   return match

>>> print re.sub('\\S+', replace, s)
SOME string

but I would argue against it on the grounds of readability: passing
information implicitly between scopes is bad.  (At this point advanced
Pythoneers might sneer at me, because scoping is natural to Python,
but nuts to them: readability and transparency is also very
important.)  You *could* also do it this way:

>>> d = { 'some' : True, 'string' : False }
>>> def replace(m, replace_dict=d):		# <-- explicit declaration
...   match = m.group()
...   if match in replace_dict and replace_dict[match]:
...      return match.upper()
...   return match

>>> print re.sub('\\S+', replace, s)
SOME string

The idea is to use keyword arguments on the function to pass in required
information, thus making the information passing explicit.

Back to sharing data
--------------------

I started discussing scope in the context of sharing data, but we got
a bit sidetracked from data sharing.  Let's get back to that now.

The key to thinking about data sharing in the context of code reuse
is to think about how that data will be used.

If you use a module global, then any code in that module has access to
that global.

If you use a class attribute, then any object of that class type
(including inherited classes) shares that data.

And, if you use an object attribute, then every object of that class
type will have its own version of that data.

How do you choose which one to use?  My ground rule is to minimize the
use of more widely shared data.  If it's possible to use an object
variable, do so; otherwise, use either a module or class attribute.
(In practice I almost never use class attributes, and infrequently use
module globals.)

.. CTB consider examples: singleton; caching experience; ...?

How modules are loaded (and when code is executed)
--------------------------------------------------

Something that has been implicit in the discussion of scope and data
sharing, above, is the order in which module code is executed.  There
shouldn't be any surprises here if you've been using Python for a
while, so I'll be brief: in general, the code at the top level of a
module is executed at *first* import, and all other code is executed
in the order you specify when you start calling functions or methods.

Note that because the top level of a module is executed precisely
once, at *first* import, the following code prints "hello, world" only
once: ::

  mod_a.py:
    def f():
       print 'hello, world'

    f()

  mod_b.py:
    import mod_a

The ``reload`` function will reload the module and force re-execution at
the top level: ::

   reload(sys.modules['mod_a'])

It is also worth noting that the module name is bound to the local
namespace *prior* to the execution of the code in the module, so not
all symbols in the module are immediately available.  This really only
impacts you if you have interdependencies between modules: for
example, this will work if ``mod_a`` is imported before ``mod_b``: ::

 mod_a.py:
   import mod_b

 mod_b.py:
   import mod_a

while this will not: ::

 mod_a.py:
   import mod_b
   x = 5

 mod_b.py:
   import mod_a
   y = mod_a.x

To see why, let's put in some print statements: ::

 mod_a.py:
   print 'at top of mod_a'
   import mod_b
   print 'mod_a: defining x'
   x = 5

 mod_b.py:
   print 'at top of mod_b'
   import mod_a
   print 'mod_b: defining y'
   y = mod_a.x

Now try ``import mod_a`` and ``import mod_b``, each time in a new
interpreter: ::

  >> import mod_a
  at top of mod_a
  at top of mod_b
  mod_b: defining y
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "mod_a.py", line 2, in <module>
      import mod_b
    File "mod_b.py", line 4, in <module>
      y = mod_a.x
  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'x'

  >> import mod_b
  at top of mod_b
  at top of mod_a
  mod_a: defining x
  mod_b: defining y

PYTHONPATH, and finding packages & modules during development
-------------------------------------------------------------

So, you've got your re-usable code nicely defined in modules, and now you
want to ... use it.  How can you import code from multiple locations?

The simplest way is to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to
contain a list of directories from which you want to import code;
e.g. in UNIX bash, ::

   % export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/directory/one:/path/to/directory/two

or in csh, ::

   % setenv PYTHONPATH /path/to/directory/one:/path/to/directory/two

Under Windows, ::

   > set PYTHONPATH directory1;directory2

should work.

.. @CTB test

However, setting the PYTHONPATH explicitly can make your code less
movable in practice, because you will forget (and fail to document)
the modules and packages that your code depends on.  I prefer to modify
sys.path directly: ::

   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/directory/one')
   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/directory/two')

which has the advantage that you are explicitly specifying the location
of packages that you depend upon in the dependent code.

Note also that you can put modules and packages in zip files and
Python will be able to import directly from the zip file; just place
the path to the zip file in either ``sys.path`` or your PYTHONPATH.

Now, I tend to organize my projects into several directories, with a
``bin/`` directory that contains my scripts, and a ``lib/`` directory
that contains modules and packages.  If I want to to deploy this code
in multiple locations, I can't rely on inserting absolute paths into
sys.path; instead, I want to use relative paths.  Here's the trick I use

In my script directory, I write a file ``_mypath.py``. ::

 _mypath.py:
    import os, sys
    thisdir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    libdir = os.path.join(thisdir, '../relative/path/to/lib/from/bin')

    if libdir not in sys.path:
       sys.path.insert(0, libdir)

Now, in each script I put ``import _mypath`` at the top of the script.
When running scripts, Python automatically enters the script's
directory into sys.path, so the script can import _mypath.  Then
_mypath uses the special attribute __file__ to calculate its own
location, from which it can calculate the absolute path to the library
directory and insert the library directory into ``sys.path``.

setup.py and distutils: the old fashioned way of installing Python packages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

While developing code, it's easy to simply work out of the development
directory.  However, if you want to pass the code onto others as a
finished module, or provide it to systems admins, you might want to
consider writing a ``setup.py`` file that can be used to install your
code in a more standard way.  setup.py lets you use `distutils
<http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html>`__ to install the software by
running ::

	python setup.py install

Writing a setup.py is simple, especially if your package is pure Python
and doesn't include any extension files.  A setup.py file for a pure Python
install looks like this: ::

  from distutils.core import setup
  setup(name='your_package_name',
	py_modules = ['module1', 'module2']
	packages = ['package1', 'package2']
	scripts = ['script1', 'script2'])

One this script is written, just drop it into the top-level directory
and type ``python setup.py build``.  This will make sure that distutils
can find all the files.

Once your setup.py works for building, you can package up the entire
directory with tar or zip and anyone should be able to install it by
unpacking the package and typing ::

   % python setup.py install

This will copy the packages and modules into Python's
``site-packages`` directory, and install the scripts into Python's
script directory.

setup.py, eggs, and easy_install: the new fangled way of installing Python packages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A somewhat newer (and better) way of distributing Python software is
to use easy_install, a system developed by Phillip Eby as part of the
setuptools package.  Many of the capabilities of
easy_install/setuptools are probably unnecessary for scientific Python
developers (although it's an excellent way to install Python packages
from other sources), so I will focus on three capabilities that I
think are most useful for "in-house" development: versioning, user
installs, and binary eggs.

First, install easy_install/setuptools.  You can do this by downloading ::

    http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

and running ``python ez_setup.py``.  (If you can't do this as the
superuser, see the note below about user installs.)  Once you've
installed setuptools, you should be able to run the script
``easy_install``.

The first thing this lets you do is easily install any software that
is distutils-compatible.  You can do this from a number of sources:
from an unpackaged directory (as with ``python setup.py install``);
from a tar or zip file; from the project's URL or Web page; from an
egg (see below); or from PyPI, the Python Package Index (see
http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/).

Let's try installing ``nose``, a unit test discovery package we'll be
looking at in the testing section (below).  Type: ::

   easy_install --install-dir=~/.packages nose

This will go to the Python Package Index, find the URL for nose,
download it, and install it in your ~/.packages directory.  We're
specifying an install-dir so that you can install it for your use
only; if you were the superuser, you could install it for everyone by
omitting '--install-dir'.

(Note that you need to add ~/.packages to your PATH and your
PYTHONPATH, something I've already done for you.)

So, now, you can go do 'import nose' and it will work.  Neat, eh?
Moreover, the nose-related scripts (``nosetests``, in this case) have
been installed for your use as well.

You can also install specific versions of software; right now, the
latest version of nose is 0.9.3, but if you wanted 0.9.2, you could
specify ``easy_install nose==0.9.2`` and it would do its best to find
it.

This leads to the next setuptools feature of note,
``pkg_resource.require``.  ``pkg_resources.require`` lets you specify
that certain packages must be installed.  Let's try it out by
requiring that CherryPy 3.0 or later is installed: ::

   >> import pkg_resources
   >> pkg_resources.require('CherryPy >= 3.0')
   Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
   DistributionNotFound: CherryPy >= 3.0

OK, so that failed... but now let's install CherryPy: ::

   % easy_install --install-dir=~/.packages CherryPy

Now the require will work: ::

   >> pkg_resources.require('CherryPy >= 3.0')
   >> import CherryPy

This version requirement capability is quite powerful, because it lets
you specify exactly the versions of the software you need for your own
code to work.  And, if you need multiple versions of something
installed, setuptools lets you do that, too -- see the
``--multi-version`` flag for more information.  While you still can't
use *different* versions of the same package in the same program, at
least you can have multiple versions of the same package installed!

Throughout this, we've been using another great feature of setuptools:
user installs.  By specifying the ``--install-dir``, you can install
most Python packages for yourself, which lets you take advantage of
easy_install's capabilities without being the superuser on your
development machine.

This brings us to the last feature of setuptools that I want to
mention: eggs, and in particular binary eggs.  We'll explore binary
eggs later; for now let me just say that easy_install makes it
possible for you to package up multiple binary versions of your
software (*with* extension modules) so that people don't have to
compile it themselves.  This is an invaluable and somewhat
underutilized feature of easy_install, but it can make life much
easier for your users.
