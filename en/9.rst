Online Resources for Python
===========================

The obvious one: http://www.python.org/ (including, of course,
http://docs.python.org/).

The next most obvious one: comp.lang.python.announce /
`python-announce
<http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-announce-list>`__.
This is a low traffic list that is really quite handy; note especially
a brief summary of postings called "the Weekly Python-URL", which as
far as I can tell is only available on this list.

`The Python Cookbook <http://www.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/>`__
is chock full of useful recipes; some of them have been extracted and
prettified in the O'Reilly Python Cookbook book, but they're all available
through the Cookbook site.

The Daily Python-URL is distinct from the Weekly Python-URL; read it
at http://www.pythonware.com/daily/.  Postings vary from daily to weekly.

http://planet.python.org and http://www.planetpython.org/ are Web sites
that aggregate Python blogs (mine included, hint hint).  Very much worth
skimming over a coffee break.

And, err, Google is a fantastic way to figure stuff out!
